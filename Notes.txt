Notes
LogisticRegression - fast and good accuracy
SVM - good accuracy, but computation time is prohibative

Insights
- volume, high, and low do not add any accuracy
- linear svm is relatively accurate, but slow
- only linear methods seem to work
- LogisticRegression is the best (works best with 'l2')
- AUC scorer
